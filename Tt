Description:

Implement JavaScript-based redirection for mobile users when the "Search" module is accessed from the Developer Portal UI. If the user enters the search input on mobile, the page should redirect to /search/docs instead of performing inline search.

This functionality should trigger only on responsive (mobile) viewports, not on desktop.

Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin format):

Scenario: Mobile user triggers search redirect

Given the user is on the Developer Portal using a mobile device or responsive viewport,

And the Search Ul module is visible,

When the user presses enter in the search input field,

Then the page should redirect to /search/docs,

And this redirection should happen using JavaScript,

And no redirection should occur on desktop view.

Technical Notes:

Add JS condition to check viewport width (<768px)

Bind keypress/submit event for search input

Prevent default action and redirect using window.location.href='/search/docs';

Should not affect desktop or tablet
