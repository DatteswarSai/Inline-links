Support client email taxonomy access validation is not working.
Non-admin users are able to view content of other client taxonomy terms. Access restriction based on mapped email domain/client is not applied.


---

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Non-admin users can only access content belonging to their own client taxonomy.

Access to other client content must return 403 Access Denied.

Admin users continue to have full access to all content.

Validation applies on node view and JSON/API routes.

When a non-admin user attempts to access a client taxonomy they are not mapped to
