🧩 1️⃣ SDLC – Software Development Life Cycle

🔹 Definition:

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used to design, develop, and maintain software.
It defines all the stages involved in creating software — from requirement gathering to maintenance after deployment.

🔹 Goal:

To deliver high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, within budget and time constraints.

🔹 Phases of SDLC:

1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis:

Business Analysts and stakeholders collect the needs of the client.

Deliverables: Business Requirement Document (BRD), Software Requirement Specification (SRS).



2. System Design:

Architects and developers design the software structure (UI, database, architecture).

Deliverables: Design Documents, Data Flow Diagrams, UML Diagrams.



3. Implementation / Coding:

Developers write the code using appropriate languages and frameworks.

Deliverables: Source Code, Code Repositories (Git, GitLab, etc.).



4. Testing:

QA/Testers validate the software against requirements.

Deliverables: Test Plans, Test Cases, Bug Reports.



5. Deployment:

The software is released to production (manual or automated deployment).

Deliverables: Release Notes, Deployed Build.



6. Maintenance:

Ongoing updates, patches, or fixes based on user feedback or new requirements.

🧠 2️⃣ Requirement Analysis

🔹 Definition:

Requirement Analysis is the first phase in STLC where testers study and understand the requirements documents (like BRD/SRS) to identify what needs to be tested.

🔹 Objective:

To ensure all requirements are testable, clear, and complete before starting test design.

🔹 Activities:

Understand the business and functional needs.

Identify testable requirements.

Analyze feasibility (functional, performance, compatibility).

Prepare Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM).

Clarify doubts with Business Analyst or Developer.


🔹 Deliverables:

Requirement Understanding Document

RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)



---

🧮 3️⃣ Verification and Validation

🔹 Definition:

These are two complementary QA activities that ensure software quality.

🔹 Verification → "Are we building the product right?"

Focuses on process and design validation.

Conducted without executing code.

Example activities:

Requirement reviews

Design reviews

Code walkthroughs

Documentation checks



🔹 Validation → "Are we building the right product?"

Focuses on actual product behavior.

Done by executing code to verify if it meets user expectations.

Example activities:

Functional testing

System testing

UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

🔁 4️⃣ STLC – Software Testing Life Cycle (Testing Cycle)

🔹 Definition:

STLC is the step-by-step process followed by QA/Testers to ensure software quality during testing.

🔹 Phases of STLC:

1. Requirement Analysis:

Understand “what to test”.

Identify testable and non-testable requirements.



2. Test Planning:

Define test strategy, scope, resources, tools, and timelines.

Create a Test Plan document.



3. Test Case Design / Development:

Write detailed test cases with steps, input data, and expected results.

Prepare test data.



4. Test Environment Setup:

Prepare the environment (servers, database, access, etc.).

Install build or deployment.



5. Test Execution:

Execute test cases.

Record results (Pass/Fail/Blocked).

Log defects in a defect tracking tool (e.g., JIRA).



6. Defect Reporting and Tracking:

Report bugs, assign severity and priority.

Track bug lifecycle until closure.



7. Test Closure:

Evaluate test completion criteria.

Prepare a Test Summary Report.

Conduct lessons learned meeting.





---

🧾 5️⃣ Defect Reporting

🔹 Definition:

When actual results differ from expected results during testing, it’s reported as a defect (bug).

🔹 Key Fields in Defect Report:

Defect ID

Title/Summary

Description

Steps to Reproduce

Expected Result

Actual Result

Screenshots/Logs (if applicable)

Severity (Critical, Major, Minor)

Priority (High, Medium, Low)

Assigned To (Developer)

Status (New, Open, Fixed, Retest, Closed, Rejected)


🔹 Tools Used:

JIRA

Bugzilla

Redmine

Mantis

Azure DevOps

🧪 6️⃣ Levels of Testing

🔹 1. Unit Testing

Performed by developers.

Tests individual functions or modules.

Example: Testing a login function only.


🔹 2. Integration Testing

Combines modules and tests interactions between them.

Types: Top-down, Bottom-up, Big Bang.


🔹 3. System Testing

Complete system is tested end-to-end.

Includes both functional and non-functional testing.


🔹 4. Acceptance Testing

Conducted by client or end-user.

Ensures software meets business needs.

Includes Alpha and Beta testing.



---

🧱 7️⃣ Types of Manual Testing

🔹 Functional Testing:

Checks if the application behaves according to requirements.

🔹 Smoke Testing:

Basic test to check build stability (“Is the build testable?”).

🔹 Sanity Testing:

Quick check after minor fix to ensure functionality works fine.

🔹 Regression Testing:

Ensures new changes haven’t broken existing features.

🔹 Re-Testing:

Testing again after a bug is fixed to verify the fix.

🔹 Exploratory Testing:

Ad-hoc testing without predefined test cases, based on experience.

🔹 Usability Testing:

Checks ease of use, UI consistency, and user experience.

🔹 Compatibility Testing:

Verifies app behavior on different browsers, devices, or OS.

🔹 Performance Testing (manual baseline):

Measures response time and speed before automation tools are used.

📋 8️⃣ Xray Test Case Creation and Execution in JIRA

🔹 Xray Overview:

Xray is a test management add-on for JIRA that helps manage and track testing activities within agile projects.

🔹 Steps:

1. Create a Test Issue:

Add test steps, data, and expected results.



2. Link Test to Requirement (Story/Epic):

Maintain traceability between requirements and tests.



3. Create Test Execution:

Combine multiple test cases for execution.

Mark results as Pass/Fail/Blocked.



4. Log Defects:

Link failed test cases to JIRA defects.



5. Test Plans and Reports:

Create Test Plans to group multiple executions.

Generate traceability and execution reports.

🐞 9️⃣ Bug vs Defect – Difference

Category	Bug	Defect

Definition	Error found by a tester during testing	Issue found by client or in production
Found By	QA/Testers	Client/End-users
Stage Found	Testing Stage	After Release
Example	Login button not working in QA	App crash in production


💡 In short:
All bugs are defects, but not all defects are bugs.


---

⚙️ 🔟 Automation Testing and Tools

🔹 Definition:

Automation testing uses scripts and tools to execute test cases automatically, reducing manual effort and human error.

🔹 Advantages:

Faster test execution

Reusable test scripts

Supports continuous integration

Better coverage and accuracy


🔹 When to Automate:

Regression tests

Repetitive and stable scenarios

High-risk or high-volume test cases


🔹 Popular Automation Tools:

Purpose	Tools

Web UI	Selenium, Cypress, Playwright
API Testing	Postman, RestAssured, Karate
Performance Testing	JMeter, LoadRunner
Mobile Testing	Appium
CI/CD Integration	Jenkins, GitLab CI
Test Management	Xray, Zephyr
