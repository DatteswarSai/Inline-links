Bug Title

Inline link error fix and content update – Production

Description

Inline links in production are showing errors when clicked or redirected. Some links either:

Navigate to an incorrect page,

Return 404/not found,

Or do not open at all.

Additionally, content associated with those inline links needs correction (wrong URL, missing URL, or outdated content). This issue affects multiple pages in production and needs both link correction and updated content rollout.

Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the affected production page(s).
2. Click on inline hyperlink(s).
3. Observe link behavior (Broken, wrong navigation, or no redirect).
4. Review associated text/content that needs correction.

Acceptance Criteria (AC)

Given inline links are fixed and content is updated in production,
When a user clicks on any inline link,
Then it should redirect to the correct page without errors, and the displayed content should match the updated requirement.
