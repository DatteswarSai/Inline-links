Inline link error fix and content update – Production

Description

Inline links in production are showing errors when clicked or redirected. Some links either:

Navigate to an incorrect page,

Return 404/not found,

Or do not open at all.

Additionally, content associated with those inline links needs correction (wrong URL, missing URL, or outdated content). This issue affects multiple pages in production and needs both link correction and updated content rollout.

Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the affected production page(s).
2. Click on inline hyperlink(s).
3. Observe link behavior (Broken, wrong navigation, or no redirect).
4. Review associated text/content that needs correction.

Acceptance Criteria (AC)

Given inline links are fixed and content is updated in production,
When a user clicks on any inline link,
Then it should redirect to the correct page without errors, and the displayed content should match the updated requirement.

Bug – Left navigation is scrolling along with the page when reaching bottom of screen (Production)


---

✅ Description

In Production, the left navigation menu is not staying fixed in position. When the user scrolls down to the bottom of the page, the left navigation continues scrolling along with the page content.
Expected behavior: Left navigation should remain fixed in place, or within its scrollable container, not move beyond its boundary.

This causes UI misalignment and affects user experience, especially on long API documentation pages.


---

✅ Steps to Reproduce

1. Open any long page with left navigation on Production.


2. Scroll down the main content to the bottom of the page.


3. Observe that left navigation moves up or down instead of staying in its fixed scrollable container.




---

✅ Actual Result

Left navigation scrolls along with page content after reaching the bottom.


---

✅ Expected Result

Left navigation should stay fixed inside its scrolling container and should not move with main content.


---

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Given the left navigation is visible on a long page,
When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page,
Then the left navigation must remain fixed in its designated container and should not scroll with the page content.
