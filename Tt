Title:
Regression Test - CSP Generate Hash Button Functionality (Style and Script)

Description:
This regression test ensures that the CSP Generate Hash button correctly generates hashes for both inline style and script tags after the latest code updates. The functionality should accurately include newly added scripts and styles without duplication or omission. It must also reflect the correct CSP hash entries in the configuration or database.

Acceptance Criteria (AC):
Given the CSP Generate Hash button is available in the Drupal admin for a specific page,
When the button is clicked after content changes,
Then the system should generate and update valid CSP hashes for both inline style and script tags without errors or missing entries.
