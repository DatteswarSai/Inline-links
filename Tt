An investigation is required to:

Identify which service/process is occupying Port 25

Determine whether the port is blocked, restricted, or intercepted

Verify mail relay configurations

Provide a recommended fix or next steps


The outcome should include logs, root cause, and proposed resolution.


---

✅ Acceptance Criteria (GIVEN / WHEN / THEN)

Given email communication relies on SMTP Port 25,
When the investigation is completed,
Then the root cause of the port conflict must be identified and a recommended solution documented for remediation

Snyk Issue Debug and Find Alternative Fix


---

✅ Description

Some security vulnerabilities reported by Snyk are not getting resolved with the current approach or dependencies upgrade.
This task is to investigate the issue in detail, identify the exact cause, and find an alternative fix if the direct patch is not available.
The work includes:

Debugging Snyk findings

Checking dependency chain and library versions

Verifying if patch/fix exists

Exploring alternative options (override, upgrade, code change, replacement package)

Documenting the recommended solution



---

✅ Acceptance Criteria (GIVEN / WHEN / THEN)

Given Snyk has reported unresolved vulnerabilities,
When debugging and analysis are completed,
Then an alternative fix or recommended solution must be documented and shared for implementation.
